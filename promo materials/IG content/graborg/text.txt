GRÅBORG

Something different this time!

Gråborg is the largest of 15 strongholds in Öland (Sweden), built in the middle of the island in a prosperous area.

Originally, Gråborg was built and settled in the Iron Age, AD 300-700. Ölanders were specialists at cattle rearing, producing skins and leather. Their goods were exported to the Roman Empire. Archeological findings tell us of contacts around the Baltic Sea and Continent and the everyday items used in the town - locks, knives, spears and ceramics from North German workshops.

Then Gråborg had a second period of greatness in the Middle Ages, 1175-1250. There was a gigantic project to reinforce the wall. Medieval excavations tell us of a town-like life with flourishing life and crafts. We learn for example that pork was in abundance in medieval Gråborg, compared to its previous incarnation.

Nowadays, Gråborg is both a tourist attraction and a feeding pasture for cute Swedish cows!
