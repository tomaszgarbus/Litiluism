The Karlevi Stone (Öl 1)

The Karlevi Stone, placed in western Öland, is considered one of the most remarkable runestones in Sweden. It is dated around AD 1000.

The inscription commemorates a chieftain named Sibbe in a poem written in the "drottkvätt" verse form.

The stone contains references to both old and new faiths: Sibbe is likened to Odin, yet on the back of the stone one can read "INONIN...EH", a corrupted form of "IN NOMINE IHESU" - In Jesus' name.
