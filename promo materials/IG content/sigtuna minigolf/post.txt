This has to be one of my favourite modern runestones, if not the favourite!

It was commissioned by Sigtuna IF (Sigtuna sport club) four yers ago when they were building a minigolf field with themes relating to the city's history. Specialists from Sigtuna museum helped produce a design for the stone, including a message for the curious visitors.

A small typo was made by the carved in the first word leading to the misspelling of "situna" into "irituna".

This runestone stands on the first hole of the minigolf field.

Thanks to Sigtuna IF and @destination_sigtuna for helping me with the translation!
