TINGANES

Tinganes is one of the world's oldest parliamentary gathering places. 
It is located in the heart of Faroe Islands' capital TÃ³rshavn.
The vikings first began meeting here as early as in the 9th century!

If you look carefully, you will see a mysterious compass-looking rock-carving on the flat stones at the top of this small peninsula.
