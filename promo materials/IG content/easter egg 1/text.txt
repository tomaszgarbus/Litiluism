Some people celebrate Easter, some don't. Either way, we can all appreciate some good Easter eggs! ðŸ¥šðŸ¥šðŸ¥š Aventure Time has plenty of those, and some of them involve Anglo-Saxon runes.

Can you read what's written on Finn's cup?

Small hint: the Anglo-Saxon futhark used in Adventure Time wrongly uses the Thorn rune (Ã¾) as "p".
