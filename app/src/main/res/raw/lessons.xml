<title>What are runes?</title>
<body>Runes are an <b>alphabetic writing system</b>, popularly (and for the most part, correctly) associated with Scandinavian culture and with the Viking Age (c. 750-1050).

Though in principle runes may be used to write in any language, they are best suited to record the sounds of old Germanic tongues.

Unlike other European scripts (roman or greek alphabets, cyrillic letters), runes are an <b>epigraphic</b> script. In other words, they were normally carved into stone, wood, metal or bone, rather than written on paper. Of course, runic manuscripts do exist, but they were produced later, from historical curiosity.

It is important to emphasize that there wasn't a single canonical runic alphabet and the scripts varied depending on both geographical and temporal dimensions.

Commonly, four main types of rune row are distinguished: <b>the older fuþark, the Anglo-Frisian fuþorc, the younger fuþark and the medieval fuþark</b>. They differed in the number of symbols, complexity and the set of expressible sounds. Even within these four types, countless local variations are found.
